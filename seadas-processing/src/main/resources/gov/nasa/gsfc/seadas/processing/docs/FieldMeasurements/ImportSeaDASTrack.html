<p>
    As another special case of the CSV import,
    SeaDAS supports the import of the ship track data generated with SeaDAS versions 6.x and prior.
</p>
<p>
    In principle, these ship track files are CSV files, but have an extremely simple layout with three columns only:
    The first two columns contain the vertex points latitudes and longitudes, respectively, and the third column
    gives the values of a single data quantity (such as a ship-based radiometer measurement). These files contain
    <b>no</b> header, all numbers are separated by the 'tab' character.
</p>
