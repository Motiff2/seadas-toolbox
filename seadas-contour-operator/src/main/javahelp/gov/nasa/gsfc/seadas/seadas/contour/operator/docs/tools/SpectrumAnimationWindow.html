<p>
    If you have opened a data product which contains spectral bands, you can use the spectrum view
    animation to animate the spectrum view for a given pixel position. <br>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/image_animator_dialog.png"></p>
    Choosing "Spectrum View" on the above Image Animator GUI opens a view which looks similar to this one:
</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="../images/spectrum_view_animation.png"></p>

<p>
    Note that the spectrum view animation can only display the intensities of <i>spectral</i> bands and animate the spectrum view.
    The spectrum view will remain empty for products without any spectral bands.
    By clicking <img src="../images/Filter24.gif"> you open the Spectrum Chooser
    which allows you to define which spectra or bands to show.
<p align="center"><img src="../images/spectrum_chooser2.png"></p>
    You can also use the Spectrum Chooser to change the symbol and line style
    of a spectrum.

    <b>Tip:</b> If you press the <code>SHIFT</code> key while moving the mouse cursor, the Sentinel Toolbox adjusts the axes to the local
    values at the current pixel position, if you release the <code>SHIFT</code> key again, then the min/max are accumulated
    again.

<p>In the following, the tool buttons of the spectrum view animation are explained.<br><br>
