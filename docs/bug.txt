Install GUI default "at least for me" is nothing selected which results in an error message.
R2020.1 should be the default.  I don't under "initial" but I never see it any more after my first launch of the GUI.
Even after deleting ~/.snap I don't see "initial".  Where is this stored?

There is no progress monitor.


This is the GUI that appears at finish:
execution exception: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /Users/seadas/.seadas9/seadas_logs/OCSSW_LOG_install_ocssw.txt (No such file or directory)

When I close GUI and reopen there is no "Last Installed Tag" and "Valid OCSSW Tags" is blank.
